Project Overview
This was my very first independent build, where I aimed to create a modern, visually engaging page based on a childhood hobby. My goal was to highlight a trend that remains relevant today. Through this project, I gained valuable experience with web development fundamentals and explored concepts that extended beyond basic design.

I focused on:

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Structuring the page, styling it with modern aesthetics, and adding interactive elements.

* Animations: Bringing the page to life with smooth, dynamic effects.

* Modal Pop-Up Windows: Enhancing user engagement with interactive overlays.

* Anchor Tags: Seamlessly linking users to external resources, including how-to media streams and e-commerce sites.

* E-Commerce and Collaborations: Experimenting with beginner-level e-commerce strategies and integrating with third-party platforms.

This project remains open for future updates and improvements as I continue to refine my skills and expand its functionality.
